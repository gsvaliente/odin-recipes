        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Risotto is a creamy Italian dish that tastes a lot like the rice version of mac and cheese. Unlike other rice recipes that require simmering in a pot of water, risotto is cooked very slowly by adding small amounts of liquid at a time. This process allows the rice to release its starches, creating a rich, velvety sauce with soft but slightly al dente grains.</p>
        <p>Risotto is best enjoyed the second it comes off the stovetop; the starches begin to set as you wait, affecting that saucy goodness you worked so hard to create. But don’t worry if you made more than you planned, because those leftovers make one of our favorite recipes. Mix the extra risotto with an egg and roll it in breadcrumbs. Fry ’em up to create delicious arancini risotto balls.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1L of chicken broth</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Shallots</li>
            <li>Arborio rice</li>
            <li>White wine</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Chives</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
